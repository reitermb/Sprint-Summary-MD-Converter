This environment is set up to sync with the [Sprint Summaries page](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Yd4Wv0Fi89kSKpmakWrn/s/PwQgUaLZ8czQbP6pKgY3/) of our GitBooks instance as a workaround to markdown not cooperating when copy/pasted directly from GitBooks edit mode. 

Content published via that space in GitBooks will appear as markdown files in this repo. These can then be copied into the project repo and should preserve all formatting & linking.
